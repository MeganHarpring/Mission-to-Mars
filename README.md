# Mission-to-Mars

### Purpose:

To scrape different data on different websites for Mars information and images. The HTML will show a Scrape New Data button where once we click on it, it will update the HTML with the newest information. I have included a section on Mars News, Mars Facts, Mars Featured Image, and images of all four Mars Hemispheres. 

The files included above are 'scraping.py' which shows the code that does the scraping from different websites, the 'app.py' which connects the scraping code and flask so that we can display the data we scrape in our own HTML, and in the templates folder is 'index.html' which shows the style and layout we want all the scraped data to be in on our webpage. 

D1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles (in addition to what we scraped in the module lesson).

D2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles.

D3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components: I added some backround colors and text color, borders, and adjusted the size of some items. I also made it so that it was able to be seen cleanly on a mobile device.
